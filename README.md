============
Nitrokey App runs under Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Lately developed under Ubuntu 16.10 with Qt5.6.

The implementation is compatible to the Google Authenticator application which can be used for testing purposes. See [google-authenticator](http://google-authenticator.googlecode.com/git/libpam/totp.html)

Using the application under Linux requires configuration of device privileges in udev (due to USB communication). The configuration is installed automatically with application (either with package or after `make install`). Without it application cannot communicate unless run with root privileges.

Known issue: tray icon under Debian Jessie
----------------
Under Debian Jessie application's tray icon might be unavailable. There were reports it can be fixed with updating Qt libraries to 5.4.2 version and up. The packages are available in experimental branch. For more details please refer to: https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-app/issues/86

Installation and downloads
-------------------------
Ready to use packages and install instructions are available on main site in download section: https://www.nitrokey.com/download

Compilation
===========


Compiling on Ubuntu Linux
-------------------------
Prerequisites for building on Ubuntu 16.10:
- libusb-1.0.0-dev # libusb library
- cmake # for compiling libnitrokey
- qt5-default # QT5.6 library


```
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0.0-dev cmake qt5-default
```

#### Getting the Nitrokey Sources

Clone the Nitrokey repository into your $HOME git folder.

```
cd $HOME
mkdir git && cd git
git clone https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-app.git --recursive
```

#### QT5
Prerequisites: Install Qt manually using [download page](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2) or through package manager:
```
sudo apt-get install qt5-default
sudo apt-get install qtcreator #for compilation using IDE
```

Use QT Creator (IDE) for compilation or perform the following steps:

- out of source build:
   1. cd to a build directory
   2. For 64 bit system (assuming Qt is installed in `~/Qt` and the app sources are in `~/git/nitrokey-app`): 
      `$HOME/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake -spec  $HOME/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/mkspecs/linux-g++-64 -o Makefile $HOME/git/nitrokey-app/nitrokey-app-qt5.pro`
   3. `make -j4`

- simple build in source directory (assuming Qt being in `$PATH`):
   `qmake && make -j4`

#### Using cmake:
General use:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\<prefix\> $HOME/git/nitrokey-app/
make -j4
make install
```

Note: In case you have downloaded Qt manually from web download page you have to set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to your corresponding Qt path.
Example: (If QT5.5 (64bit) was installed in your `$HOME` DIR): 
```
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/
```
Out of the source build is highly recomended, because you are not touching your git'ed source directory. Eg:
```
mkdir build
mkdir install
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install $HOME/git/nitrokey-app/
make -j4
sudo make install
```

#### Using qmake:
Please compile earlier libnitrokey (following instructions from its readme). QMake will search static libnitrokey library in `libnitrokey/build` directory.
```
qmake
make -j4
make install
```

You can use out-of-the-source build again:
```
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ..
make -j4 && make install
```



#### Issues  with libusb

To compile the Nitrokey App under Linux install the package `libusb-1.0.0-dev` and QT Creator (optionally). In case it would not work out-of-the-box you may need to add to the .pro file:
```
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS= -I/usr/include/libusb-1.0
QMAKE_CFLAGS= -I/usr/include/libusb-1.0
```

Note: In case `libusb-1.0.0-dev` is not available to install please check other name: `libusb-1.0-0-dev` (the difference is the `-` char between zeroes).


### Debian Packages
#### Building Debian Packages

Execute the following in directory "nitrokey-app":

```
 fakeroot make -f debian/rules binary
```

Cleanup with:
 ```
 fakeroot make -f debian/rules clean
 ```

Requirements: fakeroot, debhelper, hardening-wrapper, qt5-default, libusb-1.0-0-dev, cmake. 

#### Building RPM and Debian Packages (alternative)
CMake can generate RPM packages using CPack. It can also generate `.deb` package using other method than presented in previous section. To create both packages please execute the following in directory "nitrokey-app":
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j4 package
```
This will result in two packages: `.deb` and `.rpm`. 

#### Cross Compiling with QT5 for Windows on Ubuntu Linux (using MXE)

Please run following commands:

```
# install dependencies for compilation
sudo apt-get install bison cmake flex intltool libtool scons
# MXE GCC6, x32
#remove MXE_PLUGIN_DIRS switch to use GCC 5.4.0 instead of GCC 6
git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git && pushd mxe
make MXE_TARGETS=i686-w64-mingw32.static.posix MXE_PLUGIN_DIRS=plugins/gcc6  qtbase # takes about 1 hour first time
popd

#following should download nitrokey-app and libnitrokey with hidapi (own clone with applied OS-specific patches)
git clone https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-app.git --recursive 
pushd nitrokey-app/libnitrokey/build
ln -s ../../../mxe/usr/bin/
./bin/i686-w64-mingw32.static.posix-cmake ..
make -j
popd

mkdir nitrokey-app/build/
pushd nitrokey-app/build/
ln -s ../mxe/usr/bin/
./bin/i686-w64-mingw32.static.posix-qmake ..
PATH=$PATH:./bin make -j
popd
```


Old description (for reference) - based on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10934683/how-do-i-configure-qt-for-cross-compilation-from-linux-to-windows-target):

1. `sudo apt-get install bison cmake flex intltool libtool scons`
2. `git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git`
3. `cd mxe && make qt5`
4. `export PATH=<mxe root>/usr/bin:$PATH`
5. Change to build directory parallel to source directory, e.g. `build-nitrokeyapp-Win32-release`
6. `<mxe root>/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.static/qt5/bin/qmake -spec <mxe root>/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.static/qt5/mkspecs/win32-g++ -o Makefile ../nitrokey-app/nitrokey-app-qt5.pro`
7. `make`
8. optional: use upx to compress the executable


#### Compiling and creating a package for MAC OS
1. Use Qt (qmake) to compile the Nitrokey App
2. Navigate to `<build_dir>/<app_name>/Contents`
3. Create a .dmg file: go to the build directory and use
     
     `macdeployqt <app_name>/ -dmg`
     
   `<app_name>.dmg` file will be created at the same folder. This is the final file for distributing the App on Mac OS
4. Compress the `.dmg` package:
   * Open Disk Utility
   * Select the dmg package from left column (or drag'n'drop)
   * Select Convert, check "compressed" option and then "Save"

Tray
---

Note that the Nitrokey App's graphical interface is based on a QT system tray widget. If you are using a Linux desktop environment that does not support system tray widgets, then you may be unable to access the graphical interface.


Internals
---------
All configuration data including OTP secrets are stored in clear text in the flash of Nitrokey's microcontroller. This is not tamper resistant and may only be used for low to medium security requirements.
Password Safe is encrypted using 256 bit AES key to which access is protected with SIM card.

By default the OTP serial number (OTP Token) is OpenPGP Card's serial number. It can be changed within the GUI for each entry. The USB device serial number is set to the card's serial number when the device powers up.

(disabled feature) Keyboard Layout: The user will input the token ID values as he wants them displayed, then the gui will translate them to keycodes of the selected layout. The keycodes will be stored on the device, along with a number saying which layout was used, this number is important when the GUI application reads the conifg back from the device (to translate the keycodes back into characters).

The report protocol is described [here](https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-pro-firmware/blob/master/src/inc/report_protocol.h) for Pro and [here](https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-storage-firmware/blob/master/src/OTP/report_protocol.h) for Storage.
The HID reports are set to 64 bytes. The "output report" is what you get from the device. When you send a report (command), the first byte sets the command type, then you have 59 bytes for your data, and the last 4 bytes are the CRC32 of the whole report.

On the GUI side, please check documentation of [libnitrokey](https://github.com/Nitrokey/libnitrokey) project.
